   and had already gone international by the early 1960s, when it
   was reported at London University's ATLAS computing site.  There are
   several variants of it in circulation, some of which actually do end with
   the word &#8216;blinkenlights&#8217;.</p><p>In an amusing example of turnabout-is-fair-play, German hackers have
   developed their own versions of the blinkenlights poster in fractured
   English, one of which is reproduced here:</p><div class="literallayout"><p><span class="fraktur"><br/>

</span></p></div><p>See also <a href="../G/geef.html"><i class="glossterm">geef</i></a>.</p><p>Old-time hackers sometimes get nostalgic for blinkenlights because
   they were so much more fun to look at than a blank panel.  Sadly, very few
   computers still have them (the three LEDs on a PC keyboard certainly don't
   count). The obvious reasons (cost of wiring, cost of front-panel cutouts,
   almost nobody needs or wants to interpret machine-register states on the
   fly anymore) are only part of the story.  Another part of it is that
   radio-frequency leakage from the lamp wiring was beginning to be a problem
   as far back as transistor machines.  But the most fundamental fact is that
   there are very few signals slow enough to blink an LED these days!  With
   slow CPUs, you could watch the bus register or instruction counter tick,
   but even at 33/66/150MHz (let alone gigahertz speeds) it's all a
   blur.</p><p>Despite this, a couple of relatively recent computer designs of note
   have featured programmable blinkenlights that were added just because they
   looked cool.  The Connection Machine, a 65,536-processor parallel computer
   designed in the mid-1980s, was a black cube with one side covered with a
   grid of red blinkenlights; the sales demo had them evolving
   <a href="../L/life.html"><i class="glossterm">life</i></a> patterns.  A few years later the ill-fated
   BeBox (a personal computer designed to run the BeOS operating system)
   featured twin rows of blinkenlights on the case front. When Be,
   Inc. decided to get out of the hardware business in 1996 and instead ported
   their OS to the PowerPC and later to the Intel architecture, many users
   suffered severely from the absence of their beloved blinkenlights.  Before
   long an external version of the blinkenlights driven by a PC serial port
   became available; there is some sort of plot symmetry in the fact that it
   was assembled by a German.</p><p>Finally, a version updated for the Internet has been seen on

   &#8216;blinkenlights&#8217; is (in 1999) undergoing something of a revival
   in usage, but applied to networking equipment. The transmit and receive
   lights on routers, activity lights on switches and hubs, and other network
   equipment often blink in visually pleasing and seemingly coordinated
   ways. Although this is different in some ways from register readings, a
   tall stack of Cisco equipment or a 19-inch rack of ISDN terminals can
   provoke a similar feeling of hypnotic awe, especially in a darkened network
   operations center or server room.</p><p>The ancestor of the original blinkenlights posters of the 1950s was
   probably this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><a id="gefingerpoken"/><img src="../graphics/gefingerpoken.jpg"/><div class="caption"><p>WWII-era machine-shop poster</p></div></div><p>We are informed that cod-German parodies of this kind were very 
   common in Allied machine shops during and following WWII.  Germans,
   then as now, had a reputation for being both good with precision
   machinery and prone to officious notices.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="bletcherous.html">Prev</a></td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../B.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"><a accesskey="n" href="blit.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">bletcherous</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">blit</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
